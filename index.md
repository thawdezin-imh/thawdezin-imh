### Hi, I'm **Thaw De Zin** (​သော်ဒီဇင်)

I am **Mobile Developer**. I love to develop Mobile applications using `Kotlin` and `Swift`.
I am graduated from [University of Technology (Yatanarpon Cyber City)](https://www.utycc.edu.mm) – B.E (Information Science and Technology).

### About Me

I've done my university projects using so many languages such as C, C++, Java, PHP, Python and MATLAB in the field of **Image, AI, Web, IoT, android, Big Data, High-performance computing, Web Scraping and Web Crawling.**

After graduated, I’ve decided to choose my career life as Mobile Developer by applying the theory and technologies that I studied in University to Mobile development. For the programming, I’ve learned so many languages, even Assembly (NASM) with compiler design and structure. But I’m in love with `Kotlin` and `Swift`. For the mobile development, I’m tightly couple with `Android` and `SwiftUI`. If I have some free time, I spent by time with Web Scraping and Crawling using Python.
